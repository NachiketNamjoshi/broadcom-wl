# broadcom-wl
After getting pissed by broadcom providing unfinished drivers and modules, I decided to finish their job.

# Project Notes:
<li>26/7/16 : Initial Workaround</li>
<li>27/7/16 : Sorted/Figured out which headers are used by whom.
				<li>
					src/common - used by BCM4311-, BCM4312-, BCM4313-, BCM4321-, BCM4322-, BCM43224-, and BCM43225-, BCM43227- and BCM43228

					src/shared - still not sure, but overall everyone uses some of the headers there.

					src/include - as far as I am concerned, BCM4312 specifically uses this.
				
</li>


# Installation
